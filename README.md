# **REST API Microservice [BuggyBuddyüêû]**

## Overview

The **REST API Microservice [BuggyBuddyüêû]** plays a crucial role in the [BuggyBuddy](http://example.com) project, functioning as a RESTful API application designed to seamlessly integrate with various types of projects. Developed using FastAPI and seamlessly integrated with Swagger documentation, it provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for building and interacting with REST APIs.

## Features

- **RESTful API**:
  - Provides a comprehensive REST API interface for interacting with the BuggyBuddy system.
- **Integration with Pinecone Vector Database**:
  - Employs Pinecone for similarity searches on bug reports, aiding users in finding resolutions faster by suggesting similar resolved reports.
- **Built with FastAPI**:
  - Developed using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building asynchronous Rest APIs with Python.

## Folder Structure
Utilizing clean architecture principles, this microservice offers seamless integration with different tech stacks. Simply switch drivers/implementation in the infrastructure for effortless adaptability.

## Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

**2. Install & initialization:**

## Getting Started

To start using the BuggyBuddy REST API Microservice, follow the steps below:

1. Run the running script on your bash terminal:

```bash
./run.sh
```

2. Once the running is complete, you can interact with the system through the following endpoints:

- **GET /reports**: Retrieve details of a specific bug report by its ID.
- **GET /reports/similar**: Retrieve recommendations for similar bug reports based on the provided ID.
- **POST /reports**: Submit a new bug report to the system.
- **PUT /reports**: Submit a new bug report to the system.
- **DELETE /reports**: Submit a new bug report to the system.

The details can be found by accessing Swagger UI dashboard (**/docs**).

## Event Messaging

This microservice uses RabbitMQ event publised by the [ETL microservice]() which that inform new model is available then trigger new model loading from S3 Bucket. Below are *exchange*, *route*, and *data* of the subscribed message:

```bash
    exchange: 'train_service',
    routing_key: 'all_pipeline',
    data: {
      'status': 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILED',
      'message': 'TRAIN_PIPELINE [ALL] - SUCCESS' | <error_message>
    }
```
