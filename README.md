## Getting Started

To start using the BuggyBuddy REST API Microservice, follow the steps below:

1. Run the running script on your bash terminal:

```bash
./run.sh
```

2. Once the running is complete, you can interact with the system through the following endpoints:

- **GET /reports**: Retrieve bug reports by specific filters such id, component, platform, etc. (*require req. body*).
- **GET /reports/similar**: Retrieve 10 most similar bug reports (*require req. body*).
- **POST /reports**: Create a new bug report (*require req. body*).
- **PUT /reports/{report_id}**: Update a bug report (*require req. body*).
- **DELETE /reports/{report_id}**: Delete a bug report.

The details can be found by accessing Swagger UI dashboard (**/docs**).

## Event Messaging

This microservice subscribes to RabbitMQ events published by the [BuggyBuddy Model Builder Microservice](https://github.com/uknow19/BuggyBuddy-Model-Builder-Microservice). These events inform when a new model is available, triggering the loading of the new model from the S3 Bucket. Below are the *exchange*, *route*, and *data* of the subscribed message.

```bash
    exchange: 'train_service',
    routing_key: 'all_pipeline',
    data: {
      'status': 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILED',
      'message': 'TRAIN_PIPELINE [ALL] - SUCCESS' | <error_message>
    }
```
